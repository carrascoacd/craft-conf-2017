Cryptography mit guy
---------------------

Needs to crypto.
Evolution
Hard to implement libraries

Performance
cpu and memory
user perceived response
estra storage costs
bandwidth costs
Performance-security tradeoff very core conflict

sift to the cludformation
more users on mobile phones- weaker

groweing web application sacale

Many moving pieces - hard to control


use tailored cyptographic protocol pfor specific web application processes

basec encryption signatures
advanced fully homomorphic encryption ( computing on encrypted data)

key high level challenges
right Cryptography
performance bottlenecks
practicality

sieve: cyptographically secure acces control for user data in untrusted cluds
attibute-based encryption abe and key

Sieve
---------

motivation
share info between bds (cloud)
naive approach, encrypt data under 1 key
anodther approach: encrypt each piece of data individually

sieve new platform that allows users to selectively and securely desclose their data
user ->  cloud provider ->  webservices
sieve user client -> sieve storage daemon -> sieve data import

this is for concrete data

threat model ABE - attribute based encryption
with policy (ex. year < 2013) private -> generate deckey
public key -> encrypt
private ->    decrypt

reduce abe operations
hybrid encryption
------------------

Metadata block
|
|
GUID (symmetric) ABE key
|
|
Data(symmetric)

Revocation
-------------
Web still cached keys
Re-encrypt data

Re-encryption with Hybrid encryption

Need to metadata and data

solution key homomorphism
*in-place* Re-encryption

Splinter design
--------------
performance PIR and garbled circuits!!
less time

improve queries and response read paper

FSS properties: point function or interval functions

make query with info for different providers and divide after
