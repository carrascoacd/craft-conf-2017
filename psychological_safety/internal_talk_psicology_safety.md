# ¿What is psicology safety?

"When team members are motivated at work and want to share an idea for improving performance, they frequently do not speak up because they fear that they will be harshly judged.[5] When psychological safety is present, team members think less about the potential negative consequences of expressing a new or different idea than they would otherwise.[1] As a result, they speak up more when they feel psychologically safe and are motivated to improve their team or company."

"Safety. The idea that teams and individuals need safety to be able to collaborate"

Countinuos delivery = continuos colaboration
-> Psycology safety. The act of feeling the protection of people the safety people to feel brave and to learn in any environment but the more we use this practise the more conflic we create between teams.

Leader could improve psicological safety by: Participatory management or Inclusive management
Also A clear team structure where members understand their role on the team and Strong relationships between cohesive team members is important to achieve it.

# Fatigue phenomena
Perfection is hard to achieve in a constant world of change, we never get enough time to finish it! The three characteristics of existence: Everithing is in a constant state of change, is not about the me but the entire ecosystem (interdependency) and we are always in a battle dissatisfaction.
-> Insight is the new differenciator, the new market diferenciator. Insight in products, employers and market in general. Human beings are the "thing" that collaborates and generate insight.
-> Continuos consequence and collaboration in order to achive that insight.
(see minute 17 to show the slide about continuos delivery across a year)
Each delivery has an impact: a consequence, impact can be feedback, strategy adjustment, profit/loss, team's reaction.
Everyone need to know everything in order to respond quickly and well, so we need to collaborate. One person don't know everithing. See the table of 20:51 minute about continuos delivery and continuos collaboration.
-> Fatigue phenomena, but if you don't manage this high level of interaction: collaboration fatigue, decision fatigue and empatht fatugue. Tired, exhausted.

# Dark triad
This state of stress can trigger a "soft" combination of: narcissim (me, me, me), pychopathy(controlling, hearless, remorseless, selfish), machiavellianism (manipulative). In all of us!
# Cicle of delusion
27 emotions per hour every persion feel. Resilience is needed in every persion so sometimes the problem is internal.
Emotion is a human reponse to insight.
Cycle of delusion (slide minute 42:10): 90% crave (we are really working hard to achieve the achievement) and cling (we are happy keeping this feeling of safety) 10% Achivement (we should focus on this). As the picture shows we only achieve emocional safety the 10% of the time and the rest of the time we are really working hard to get safe or get happy and trying to keep that safety (cling the own victories). So this could become in an state of insatisfaction.

How in that context can be a team properly safe? Focus on that 10% to get alternatives ways. You can't not find emocional safety in others. Now is the time for resistance, for persistence and for braveness, we are part of an industry that is revolucionary where everithing is changing and for the interdependency.

- Google did a large study about how to build nice teams and it concluded psicological safety is very important to achieve it. On one hand it comes up the safety in a team is important because it makes the team dynamic, but a lot of creative work could break bad.
"The news gets worse from there. According to a 2009 paper published in Psychological Science, when one individual feels safe enough to be brazenly unethical, others who identify as part of that group are tempted to go down the same road. In other words, one bad apple can rot the whole barrel."
"But in the wrong context—that is, in a company with bad hiring practices, perverse incentives, or toxic leadership—psychological safety can be a recipe for disaster. It’s too soon to say what’s at the heart of the Wells Fargo crisis. But it is clear that a climate that helps teams do their best work isn’t enough to cure all ethical ills"
